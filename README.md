# CSharp_EventsAndDelegates
A small console app that demonstrates how to use event handling to promote loose coupling in your app.

Developed using VS2015 Comunity

#####How it works

This example simulates account processing. When an account has been processed, an event is triggered that alerts a 'MailService' object. This example has been designed so that additional services can be added without having to change the existing code.
